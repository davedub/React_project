# React Basics

This project tracks the [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXmpxz_-pBU&list=PLkEZWD8wbltnXlfyhS5qSMTNb26utkOkI) by Petr Tichy, a/k/a [ihatetomatoes](https://ihatetomatoes.net/), for learning React.

### Note

This is **not** the same as the [React 101](git@github.com:Ihatetomatoes/react-101.git) project that Petr's repo says are "all the working files for the React 101 tutorials published on YouTube." As far as I can tell, that project tracks [the project on Petr's ihatetomatoes website](https://ihatetomatoes.net/r101/).
